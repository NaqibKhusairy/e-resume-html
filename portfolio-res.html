				<h2>Skills</h2>
					<p>
						Throughout these 4 semesters, I have improved my skills on Information Technology. 
						I have learned to use Adobe PhotoShop, Premiere Pro, Auditon and Animate. I have 
						also learned coding in several languages such as C++, C#, C, Java, JavaSrcipt, HTML, 
						Css and Python. It's a lot of information to absorb in four semesters, but it also 
						makes the program easier to learn. I can now implement programming skills in multiple 
						languages to make it better and more interesting.

				<h2>Involvements</h2>
					<p>
						I am now in the JTMK Robotics Club. In this club, we have programmed the robots according 
						to the tasks given such as walking, dancing, moving along the line, stopping and beeping 
						when they see an obstacle in front of them and we have also made a program for sumobots . 
						Besides robotics, I am also active in sports such as playing Basketball, Badminton, Futsal 
						and Esport. I hope that with these involvements of mine, I can bring these experiences to a 
						higher direction and be able to raise and enrich the name of the country.
